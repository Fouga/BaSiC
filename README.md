# BaSiC

This is a fork of the [BaSiC backgound correction pipeline](https://github.com/QSCD/BaSiC). To run the pipeline you need to clone [this repository](https://github.com/Fouga/BaSiC) and [StitchIt](https://github.com/Fouga/StitchIt). 

# Example
```Matlab
source_dir = '/DATA_NAME/'; % here you need to have rawData directory with all your data and a Mosaic.txt

addpath(genpath('FULL_PATH/StitchIt/code/')); % add path of the StitchIt(https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt).

addpath(genpath('FULL_PATH/cidre/')); % add path of the CIDRE(https://github.com/Fouga/cidre) 

cd (source_dir);

% maKE INI FILE
if ~exist('stitchitConf.ini')
	makeLocalStitchItConf
end

% read info from Mosaic.txt 
M=readMetaData2Stitchit;

%check for and fix missing tiles if this was a TissueCyte acquisition
if strcmp(M.System.type,'TissueCyte')
    writeBlacktile = 0;
    missingTiles=identifyMissingTilesInDir('rawData',0,0,[],writeBlacktile);
else
    missingTiles = -1;
end

% correct background illumination with cidre
alternativeIlluminationCorrection('basic')


% stitch all the data
stitchAllChannels
```
